Hi Antons,

Below is a small Android task we would like you to complete to see your general Android skill.

Create a "Top Contributor" Android app that, using GitHub API does the following:
1. Displays the list of trending GitHub repositories for the last month. Each list tile should contain repository name, most used language in that repository,
amount of contributors and the organisation (if it belongs to one).
2. Clicking on repository tile should display its top contributor - the info should contain their login name, email, bio, and the profile picture.

Non functional requirements:
1. Use latest android libraries & architectural approaches you are aware of.
2. Unit test your solution (a couple of JUnit and UI tests will be enough, no need to strive for 100% coverage -
in real world you would of course want to do that but we just want to see how familiar are you with unit testing)

Optional bonus point:
- App caches the data and keeps showing it when device is not connected to the network.


Best regards,
Tair.
